# KozakInvestigation
Data and scripts used in investigation of Kozak sequence and its impact on pathogenesis of Mendelian disorders. 
Data folder contains the following files:
* _genemap2.txt_ - source OMIM file.
* _total_OMIM_MANE.csv_ - file of OMIM genes with inheritance type defined, merged with MANE transcripts coordinates.
* _CDS_gnomAD.csv_ - unfiltered file of gnomAD variants info retrieved for Kozak sequence + start-codon coordinates.
* _CDS_gnomAD_filtered.csv_ - filtered file of CDS_gnomad.csv with filters like SNVs selection, QC flags and total exome and genome counts filtering.
