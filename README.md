# KozakInvestigation
Data and scripts used in investigation of Kozak sequence and its impact on pathogenesis of Mendelian disorders. 
Data folder contains the following files:
* genemap2.txt - source OMIM file
* total_OMIM_MANE.csv - file of OMIM genes with inheritance type defined, merged with MANE transcripts coordinates.
* CDS_gnomAD.csv - unfiltered file of gnomAD variants info retrieved for Kozak sequence + start-codon coordinates.
* CDS_gnomAD_filtered.csv - filtered file of CDS_gnomad.csv with filters like SNVs selection, QC flags and total exome and genome counts filtering
